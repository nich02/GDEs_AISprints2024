This project focuses on building a geospatial machine learning solution for decision making. 

To become a proactive organization, SafeLivestock anticipates threats of animal disease epidemics. It employs use of predictive technique to forecast animal diseases. The use case was used to predict and create awareness for better preparedness in case of emergencies. Communities provides food millions to millions of households, hence a food security resource.

Predicting animal diseases can help prevent or mitigate the impact of the diseases which spread even to humans. By predicting the likelihood of disease outbreaks, authorities can take preventive measures such as vaccination programs, biosecurity measures, and movement restrictions, which can help reduce the spread of diseases among animals.

Business Solution: To tackle these challenges,

Our use case centres around conducting a time-series analysis of animal diseases, factoring in various dimensions such as region, animal type, and specific diseases, along with their various combinations. Furthermore, it incorporates a dynamic selection process, enabling the user to choose the dimensions on which the predictions will be based.
